## Description

This application using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to manage a company's employee database.

- The purpose of developing such an app is to assist businesses in keeping track of data on their employees, such as their names, roles, salaries, and managers. Employees can quickly and simply add, update, and delete information about other employees.
